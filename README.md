# ReactJS/Django - Media Review/Recording App

### Description :
Whenever I watch or read something, I like to jot down my thoughts in a notepad. This helps me track how my opinions on various pieces of media evolve over time. However, I’ve noticed a gap in existing media recording platforms—they tend to focus on specific types of media rather than offering a comprehensive solution. Additionally, many of these platforms lack an intuitive and visually appealing interface. To address this, I developed YourMedia, a full-stack media tracking system built with ReactJS and Django. The platform serves as an all-in-one personal review hub, allowing me to log and manage all the media I consume, whether it's books, movies, or TV shows. For each entry, the system stores the title, genre, rating, image, and my personal review in the backend. Axios is used to retrieve, add, update, and delete entries, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience.

### Technologies used :
    - ReactJS 
    - Django with an Sqllite database
    - Django Rest Framework

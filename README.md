# ReactJS/Djano - Media Review/Recording App

### Description :
Whenever I watch or read something I like to jot down my opinion of it on a notepad so that later down the line I can see how my opinion on a piece of media changes.
A gap I found in recording media platforms is that they target specific types of media not all of them. Along with the that the interfaces of some of these web applications aren't that appealing. YourMedia is a full stack media recording system creating using ReactJS and Django with the goal of providing an all in one personal review platform to track all my watched/read media. For each piece of media its title, genre, my rating of it, image and my review is stored in the backend then called using Axios. With Axios the application is also able to update and delete posts.

### Technologies used :
    - ReactJS 
    - Django with an Sqllite database
    - Django Rest Framework
